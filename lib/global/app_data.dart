          country to license all private landlords. The Mayor and Newham councillors approved the pioneering scheme
         -covering an estimated 35,000 private tenancies (one in three of all the borough's households)
          What does this mean to Landlords? Licensing is broken up into 2 sections; mandatory licensing, additional
          and selective area licensing.</span></p>
    <p><span>The entry level licence which is applicable to every rental property in the borough
          of Newham is called a selec-tive area licence, this license costs &pound;500 and must be held for each
          rental property owned by a landlord in the Borough of Newham. The next level of licence required, is called
          an additional license which also costs &pound;500, however this licence is applicable to larger type (middle
          sized) properties which may accommodate a larger number of occupants who may share facilities within the
          property. The exact criteria for this licence is set by the borough on an individual basis after taking into
          account room sizes, number of bathrooms etc</span></p>
    <p><span>To find out if your property falls under this criteria you will need to call the
          borough of Newham and give them the property details, they will then guide you accordingly.. The final level
          of Licence required is called a manda-tory licence. Mandatory licenses can cost anything from &pound;500 to
          several thousand pounds; however our expe-rience tells us that the cost is in the region of &pound;900
         -&pound;1200 in the Newham area.</span></p>
    <p><span>The mandatory licence requires the landlord to implement a number of health and
          safety improvements to the property, including mains supplied fire alarms, extra bathroom facilities
          (dependent on number of occupants), these are just a couple of examples, Please contact your local borough
